#criptography

	Welcome, this is just another repo of cryptography programs.
	The plan is to upload a bunch of cypher encryptors and decryptors.

	Currently my main language is C, so it may take a while until Java and Python alternatives are uploaded, but whenever I find the time I'll work on that!

	If you know as much as Jon Snow, here's how to compile the program:

	`make`

	and that's it, haha.
