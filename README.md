# criptography

Welcome, this is just another repo of cryptography programs.
The plan is to upload a bunch of cypher encryptors and decryptors.

Currently my main language is C, so it may take a while until Java and Python alternatives are uploaded, but whenever I find the time I'll work on that!

The xor.c is a cypher that can decrypt or encrypt a string of characters by having a key string to make the operation xor with.
In the encryption you input the message string and the key string and it outputs your encoded string.
In the decryption mode you input your encoded message and it decrypts it, giving you the raw string.
